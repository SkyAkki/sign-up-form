Learnings
1. Adding this article here as a reference as it was used in every project till now.
https://softauthor.com/css-make-background-image-full-screen/
2. Submit button must fall inside the form tag. (Who could have guessed!)
3. Parent of a Absolute postitioned element must have fixed width/height? 

Improvements
1. Any better method to apply the semi-transparent background behind the ODIN Logo?
2. ODIN Logo and Banner is not resizing with browser window. Make it somewhat responsive.
3. Form-area is going under the background image on reducing the screen-size somehow.
4. Confirm password needs added validation
5. Invalid/Valid psuedo-classes overlapping the focus psuedo-class so removed for now.
